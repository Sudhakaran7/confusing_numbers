Given a number N, return true if and only if it is a confusing number, which satisfies the following condition:
We can rotate digits by 180 degrees to form new digits. When 0, 1, 6, 8, 9 are rotated 180 degrees, they become 0, 1, 9, 8, 6 respectively. 
When 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are rotated 180 degrees, they become invalid. A confusing number is a number that when rotated 180 degrees becomes a 
different number with each digit valid.

Input Description:
Number N as integer as input.

Output Description:
Print True or False
